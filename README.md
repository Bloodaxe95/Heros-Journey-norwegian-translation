### Hero's Journey is a datapack inspired by jack-bagel's [End Remastered](https://modrinth.com/mod/endrem) mod! There are 16 different eyes to collected littered around the world, you will need to gather 12 different ones to open the end portal and go to The End!

The main intention of this datapack is to encourage players to do things they wouldn't normally do in the game, when was the last time you built a turtle sanctuary?

Hero's Journey **IS** compatible with any datapack that modifies loot tables. This datapack does not modify any loot tables, and inserts the eyes using other methods to maximise compatibility.

All available eyes and hints to their locations can be found in this datapack's advancements! If you want more detail, check out the [wiki](https://github.com/maybejake/Heros-Journey/wiki)!
